# challenge week one 

## Refactoring code to follow acceptance criteria 

-I am very excited to learn HTML and CSS technology,and this is my motivation. .

-I build this project because I like to read the code and figure out how it should work.

-In this project, I replace non-semantic elements with semantic elemets,
 and a semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
 Add an alt attribute to the images and icons to make a website to be accessible.
 Changed the title element to concise and descriptive to help search engine to find a website.

-Refactoring the code helped me to understand more clearly the connection between HTML and CSS files.
